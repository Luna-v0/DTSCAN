# DTSCAN: Delaunay Triangulation-Based Spatial Clustering

Implementation of the DTSCAN algorithm from:

**"Delaunay Triangulation-Based Spatial Clustering Technique for Enhanced Adjacent Boundary Detection and Segmentation of LiDAR 3D Point Clouds"**
by Jongwon Kim and Jeongho Cho (2019)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run comprehensive testing and HPO
uv run jupyter notebook notebooks/complete_testing_and_hpo.ipynb
```
